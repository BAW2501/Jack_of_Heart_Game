Set-Up
Player Limit: 20 (Technically 19)

Time Limit: 1 hour/round

Players must equip an explosive collar upon entry. Players also may not bring in any reflective surfaces or materials. Before the game begins, a mark appears behind each player’s collar, renditioning everyone unable to see their own mark (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts).

Rules
Each round is 1 hour. Players are free to talk anywhere during this time.
In the final 5 minutes, all players must enter a cell and announce the mark that they think is on the back of their collar. If they’re correct, they move onto the next round. Their mark changes, and the cycle repeats.
If the player remains silent or says the wrong mark, the collar explodes.
Among the players is the Jack of Hearts. When the Jack of Hearts dies, the remaining players all survive and the game is cleared.
If two players remain (Jack of Hearts included), only the Jack of Hearts will live, since their identity will become apparent.
3 actions are prohibited:
No more than 1 person may reside inside a locked cell.
Players may not obstruct other players from entering a cell.
Players may not revoke another's ability to announce their own mark (homicide).
Game Clear: Kill the Jack of Hearts

Game Over:

Say the wrong mark.
Remain silent during confinement.
Commit a prohibited action.
Be the only person left alongside the Jack of Hearts.
Details
In the prison, there are no reflective surfaces. All knives in the kitchen are ceramic, faucets dispense tomato juice, and there are no mirrors. Since the penitentiary is so large and spacious, it is subtly encouraged for players to have discrete conversations discussing claims and strategies. Since there was a half year’s supply of food stocked, it was initially believed that Solitary Confinement was meant to be a game of attrition.
